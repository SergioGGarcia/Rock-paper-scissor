# Rock-paper-scissor
Rock-paper-scissor game developed with JavaScript. I developed it when I was at the DAW's higher degree training cycle.

## How to play
You will play rock-paper-scissor against the CPU. There are 3 buttons, each of them is an item, rock, paper or scissors. You have to click one of the buttons to select the item and the CPU will respond to you.
There is another button that changes the game mode, in which the CPU will always try to win. Finally, if you want to finish the game you will have to press the "end" button and a history will appear with the result of the game.
